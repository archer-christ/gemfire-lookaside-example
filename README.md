These steps are provided in order to run Gemfire and this example on your local machine.

1. Install Gemfire. Instructions for installing can be found on the [Pivotal Gemfire page](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/gemfire/getting_started/installation/install_intro.html). For a OSX machine install can be as simple as the following:

```
    brew untap pivotal/tap

    brew install gemfire
```

2. Create an account which can access the Pivotal Commercial Maven Repository.
